# How To Contribute

Contributions are welcomed in this repository!  Please familiarize yourself with the README document before you begin, and also with Hwatu and its rules, which can be found here: [https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Play-Go-Stop/](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Play-Go-Stop/)

Please make pull requests to the **illustration branch**, and not main, to be merged later at the developer's discretion.  *This way the main branch will always include installable code.* 

There are three ways that you can contribute:
1. Look through the repository's Issues and choose one to resolve.  Feel free to comment with any questions.
2. Edit IDEAS.md and add your own ideas/things you would like to see in this repository.  In the same vein, you can also open your own issue, which is always welcomed (especially if it's based off of a note in IDEAS.md).
3. Add documentation to any source code!  This is extremely helpful.  
  When adding comments/documentation to java files, please use comments after brackets to delineate the closing of each bracket pair.  This is simply a stylistic request from the repository owner, as she feels it aids greatly in the code's organization:
  
Instead of:
`public class Deck {
}`

Do:

`public class Deck{
}//close Deck class`
